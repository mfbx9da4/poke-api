# Poke API SDK

A Typescript SDK for the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/about).

## Installation

```bash
npm install poke-api
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { PokeSDK } from "poke-api";
const result = await PokeSDK.pokemon.get(1);
if (result.ok) {
  console.log(result.data); // Type Pokemon
} else {
  console.error(result.error); // Type string
  console.error(result.status); // Type number
  console.error(result.data); // Type any
  console.error(result.errorCode); // Type enum PokeSDK.errorCode
}
```

### Get Pokemon

Pok√©mon are the creatures that inhabit the world of the Pok√©mon games. They can be caught using Pok√©balls and trained by battling with other Pok√©mon. Each Pok√©mon belongs to a specific species but may take on a variant which makes it differ from other Pok√©mon of the same species, such as base stats, available abilities and typings. See Bulbapedia for greater detail.

```typescript
const result = await PokeSDK.pokemon.get(1);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getByName` method to get a Pok√©mon by name.

```typescript
const result = await PokeSDK.pokemon.getByName("bulbasaur");
```

```typescript
// üëá `result.data`
type Pokemon = {
  /* The identifier for this resource */
  id?: number;
  /* The name for this resource */
  name?: string;
  /* The base experience gained for defeating this Pok√©mon */
  base_experience?: number | null;
  /* The height of this Pok√©mon in decimetres */
  height?: number;
  /* Set for exactly one Pok√©mon used as the default for each species */
  is_default?: boolean;
  /* Order for sorting. Almost national order, except families are grouped together. */
  order?: number;
  /* The weight of this Pok√©mon in hectograms */
  weight?: number;
  /* A list of abilities this Pok√©mon could potentially have. */
  abilities?: PokemonAbility[];
  /* A list of forms this Pok√©mon can take on */
  forms?: NamedAPIResource[];
  /* A list of game indices relevent to Pok√©mon item by generation */
  game_indices?: VersionGameIndex[];
  /* A list of items this Pok√©mon may be holding when encountered */
  held_items?: PokemonHeldItem[];
  /* A link to a list of location areas, as well as encounter details pertaining to specific versions */
  location_area_encounters?: string;
  /* A list of moves along with learn methods and level details pertaining to specific version groups */
  moves?: PokemonMove[];
  /* A set of sprites used to depict this Pok√©mon in the game */
  sprites?: PokemonSprites;
  /* The species this Pok√©mon belongs to */
  species?: NamedAPIResource;
  /* A list of base stat values for this Pok√©mon */
  stats?: PokemonStat[];
  /* A list of details showing types this Pok√©mon has */
  types?: PokemonType[];
};
```

### Get Stat

Stats determine certain aspects of battles in the games. Each Pok√©mon has a value for each stat which grows as they gain levels and can be altered momentarily by effects in battles. Each stat may also have a maximum value which if reached, will prevent the Pok√©mon from gaining any more EVs in that stat. See Bulbapedia for greater detail.

```typescript
const result = await PokeSDK.stats.get(1);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getByName` method to get a stat by name.

```typescript
const result = await PokeSDK.stats.getByName("hp");
```

```typescript
// üëá `result.data`
type Stat = {
  /* The identifier for this resource */
  id?: number;
  /* The name for this resource */
  name?: string;
  /* ID the games use for this stat */
  game_index?: number;
  /* Whether this stat only exists within a battle */
  is_battle_only?: boolean;
  /* A detail of moves which affect this stat positively or negatively */
  affecting_moves?: MoveStatAffectSets;
  /* A detail of natures which affect this stat positively or negatively */
  affecting_natures?: NatureStatAffectSets;
  /* A list of characteristics that are set on a Pok√©mon when its highest base stat is this stat */
  characteristics?: APIResource[];
  /* The class of damage this stat is directly related to */
  move_damage_class?: NamedAPIResource;
  /* The name of this resource listed in different languages */
  names?: Name[];
};
```

### Get Nature

Natures influence how a Pok√©mon's stats grow. See Bulbapedia for greater detail.

```typescript
const result = await PokeSDK.natures.get(1);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getByName` method to get a nature by name.

```typescript
const result = await PokeSDK.natures.getByName("hardy");
```

```typescript
// üëá `result.data`
type Nature = {
  /* The identifier for this resource */
  id?: number;
  /* The name for this resource */
  name?: string;
  /* The stat decreased by 10% in Pok√©mon with this nature */
  decreased_stat?: NamedAPIResource;
  /* The stat increased by 10% in Pok√©mon with this nature */
  increased_stat?: NamedAPIResource;
  /* The flavor hated by Pok√©mon with this nature */
  hates_flavor?: NamedAPIResource;
  /* The flavor liked by Pok√©mon with this nature */
  likes_flavor?: NamedAPIResource;
  /* A list of Pok√©athlon stats this nature effects and how much it effects them */
  pokeathlon_stat_changes?: NatureStatChange[];
  /* A list of battle styles and how likely a Pok√©mon with this nature is to use them in the Battle Palace or Battle Tent. */
  move_battle_style_preferences?: MoveBattleStylePreference[];
  /* The name of this resource listed in different languages */
  names?: Name[];
};
```
